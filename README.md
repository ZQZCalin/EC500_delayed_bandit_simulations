# EC500: Delayed Multi-armed Bandits

Simulation of EC500 class project on delayed multi-armed bandit algorithm based on [Zimmert and Seldin's work](Simulation of EC500 class project on Delayed Multi-armed Bandit).
The bandit algorithm receives losses from local updates of online sub-gradient descent (OSD) algorithms with different learning rates.

### Instruction
1. Run `OSD_time_series.py` to get generate OSD losses.
2. Run `experiment.py` to run the experiment on the bandit algorithm and the generated losses.
